#Description of Problem: I am trying to create randomly generated sentances from various text files. Using "n-grams" specified by the user I am trying to create sentences that make sense.
#Program input: Perl ngram.pl n m (any number of Filenames)
    # n is how big of an n-gram that should be mused
    # m is how many randomly generated sentences you wants
    # (any number of Filenames) add any amount of files you would like. Filenames and extentions for example 1399.txt

#Algorithm
  #Firstly I take in the user inputed
  #Next I read in the text files the user inputted if all other inputs are correct.
  #After I read the text files I split the text files on . ? and !
  #Then I split the sentence array into word arrays
  #I create 2 different arrays 1 for ngrams and one for n-1 gram inorder to properly calculate relative frequency
  #I add both arrays into 2 $hashkeys
  #Then sort Both
  #Inorder to come up with random sentences I was unable to use relative frequencies
  #I created a random sentence using the sorted hash keys from the hash table
  #print the random sentences
